1. Simple Code

2. Linear Code
const emailOwner = async () =>{
    const issue = await getIssue();
    const owner = await getOwner(issue.ownerId);
    const email = await sendEmail(owner.email,`some text`);
    console.log('email sent to owner');
}

3. Fail Fast Approach

4. Better method & variable naming convention

5. Functions should do one thing
Function should not be larger than 20â€“25 lines.Smaller the 
function is better. Function should either modify or query 
something but not both. Consider the following code.
